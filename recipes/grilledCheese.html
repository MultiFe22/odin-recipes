        It has 3 types of cheeses and a kick. 
        It will make you feel so grown up just eating it.

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>4 slices whole wheat bread</li>
        <li>2 slices white American cheese</li>
        <li>4 thin slices tomato</li>
        <li>Â½ avocado, thinly sliced (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 slices provolone cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat skillet on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
            Spread 1/2 tablespoon butter onto one side of each slice of bread to cover evenly. 
            With buttered sides of the bread facing out, layer 1 slice American cheese, 2 slices tomato, 
            and 2 slices avocado onto each of 2 of the bread slices. Sprinkle about half the basil, 
            red pepper flakes, and garlic salt atop the avocado layer. 
            Finish by topping each with half the mozzarella and 1 slice provolone. 
            Top each with 1 of the remaining bread slices with the buttered side facing out.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook in hot skillet until bread is golden brown 
            and cheese is melted, 3 to 
            4 minutes per side.
        </li>
    </ol>
